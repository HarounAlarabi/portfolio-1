        I have extensive experience working with a wide range of technologies,
        including but not limited to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js,
        Express.js, SQL, Git, and more. I'm always excited to learn new
        technologies and expand my skill set to stay up-to-date with the latest
        industry trends and best practices. With my strong foundation in
        software development, I am confident in my ability to quickly adapt to
        new technologies and contribute effectively to any project.
